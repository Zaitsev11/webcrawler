==========

A basic webcrawler with a search engine built in

	/**
	 * Hello and Welcome.
	 * 
	 * This project is a basic web crawler which outputs to a mySQL database.
	 * The purpose of this program is to perform the following:
	 * 1) Parse Wikipedia for a list of alcoholic beverages
	 * 2) Add the first paragraph of each entry into the database
	 * 3) Query the database for related terms and group similar alcoholic beverages together (e.g. - if 'Coors light' and 'Budweiser'
	 * 	Wikipedia articles both have the word 'beer' in it, then they are similar.
	 * 4) 
	 * 
	 * TLDR; This program is a search engine specifically for alcoholic beverages.
	 * 
	 * The purpose of writing this program is to increase my knowledge and skills in programming in relation to 'big data' and how to handle the data.
	 * This program will be scalable in form.
	 * 
	 * Enjoy!
